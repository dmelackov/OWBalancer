## Manage Customs
P.S - Customs are "profiles" of players created by different users. You can use other users's customs, but you can't edit not your own custom. 
Depending on the settings of the workspace (custom system), there can be 2 options for working with custom:
* if "noCustom" setting is ON in the workspace, then custom will not be used and all players will be shared between different users
* else there is a menu when you trying to add player to lobby:

  Here you can select which one of the customs you want to add into the lobby.
  Your own custom is highlighted with green.
